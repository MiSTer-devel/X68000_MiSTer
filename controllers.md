# [Sharp X68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)

List of games compatible with the various controller types.
Note that in many cases, the controller type may need to be chosen (and/or configured) within a game "Configuration" menu
within the game, as they may not be automatically detected.

**Please consult the game instructions manuals**

Also note that "Confirmed" games don't necessarily run bug-free on the X68000 core; they have been tested
for joystick compatibility, not game playability on the current core.

## Work in progress...
Please help contribute to this list of games in order to help reduce confusion.

## 2-button controller
As this is the standard controller, any game which is compatible with controllers can use this controller

## 2-button Turbo
This is the same basic controller with additional buttons mapped as faster repeats of the original two buttons
(B-Y-L and A-X-R progression). This can be helpful in shooting games.
